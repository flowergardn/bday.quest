# bday.quest

The mission of `bday.quest` is to allow users to create birthday cards, where people can sign in and sign that particular birthday card. Once its the persons birthday, the card is then shown and the person can see all the wishes.

## Tech stack

https://bday.quest/ uses a small amount of tech to make this all possible. Firstly, made with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#the-t3-stack).

- Next.js
- Prisma
- tRPC
- Clerk
- TailwindCSS
